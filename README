# College Event Management Project

Problem Statement
We needed a way to manage college events, track budget, and allow coordinators to edit details while keeping data secure.

Solution
I built a solution on Salesforce using:
Custom Objects: College Events
Security:WD set to Public Read Only, Sharing Rules for Coordinators.
Automation:A Salesforce Flow to handle [mention what your flow does, e.g., "Auto-approve budget" or "Send Email Notifications"].

Implementation
See the attached screenshots for the Flow Logic.
